        <h2>1 INFORMATION ABOUT US</h2>

        <p>DRINKTANK is an intelligence network that provides insights to its clients via its collective of industry
          professionals providing work-finding services. <span>DRINKTANK</span> (“The Company”) needs to process
          personal data (including sensitive personal data) so that it can provide these services – and in doing so, the
          Company acts as a Data Controller.
          <br><br>
          You may give your personal details to the Company directly, such as on an application or registration form or
          via our website, or we may collect them from another source such as an advertisement, a referral or a CV. The
          Company must have a legal basis for processing your personal data. For the purposes of providing you with
          work-finding services and/or information relating to roles relevant to you we will only use your personal data
          in accordance with the terms of the following statement.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="page-block">
        <h2>2 collecting and use of personal data</h2>

        <p>
          a. Purpose of processing and legal basis
          The Company will collect your personal data (which may include sensitive personal data) and will process your
          personal data for the purposes of providing you with work-finding services. This includes for example,
          contacting you about job opportunities, assessing your suitability for those opportunities, updating our
          database, putting you forward for job opportunities, arranging payments for you and developing and managing
          our services and relationships with you and our clients.
          <br><br>
          In some cases we may be required to use your data for the purpose of investigating, reporting and detecting
          crime and also to comply with laws that apply to us. We may also use your information during the course of
          internal audits to demonstrate our compliance with certain industry standards.
          <br><br>
          The legal bases we rely upon to offer these services to you are:
        </p>

        <br>

        <ul>
          <li>Your consent</li>
          <li>Where we have a legitimate interest</li>
          <li>To comply with a legal obligation that we may have</li>
          <li>To fulfil a contractual obligation that we have with you</li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        <p>
          b. Legitimate interest
          This is where the Company has a legitimate reason to process your data provided it is reasonable and does not
          go against what you would reasonably expect from us. Where the Company has relied on a legitimate interest to
          process your personal data our legitimate interests are as follows:
          <br><br>
          Where the processing of an individual’s personal data is based on a legitimate interest then the Company must
          set out the legitimate interests that they or a third party have pursued to process the data.
          <br><br>
          This can include for example:
        </p>

        <br>

        <ul>
          <li>Managing your database and keeping work-seeker records up to date;</li>
          <li>Contacting the individual to seek your consent where you need it;</li>
          <li>
            Providing work-finding services to the individual, including sending their information to clients where they
            have demonstrated an interest in doing that particular type of work but not expressly consented to you
            passing on their specific details;
          </li>
          <li>
            Contacting the individual with information about similar products or services that they have used from you
            recently
          </li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        <p>
          c. Recipient/s of data
          The Company will process your personal data and sensitive personal data with the following recipients: Where
          you have processed the individual’s data with a third party you will be obliged to inform the individual who
          such recipients or categories of recipients of that data are.
          <br><br>
          These include for example:
        </p>

        <br>

        <ul>
          <li>Clients that you introduce or supply individuals to</li>
          <li>Candidates’ former or prospective new employers that you obtain or provide references to</li>
          <li>Any other third parties who carry out audits to ensure that you run your business correctly</li>
          <li>Legal advisers</li>
          <li>Social n etworks</li>
          <li>IT and CRM providers</li>
          <li>
            Any public information sources and third-party organisations that you may use to carry out suitability
            checks on work-seekers (e.g. Companies House)
          </li>
          <li>Trade unions;</li>
          <li>Any other organisations an individual asks you to share their data with.</li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        <p>
          d. Statutory/contractual requirement
          Personal data is required by law and/or a contractual requirement (e.g. our client may require this personal
          data), and/or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract. You are obliged to provide the personal data
          and if you do not the consequences of failure to provide the data is likely to be a fine.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="page-block">
        <h2>3 data and retention</h2>

        <p>The Company will retain your personal data only for as long as is necessary for the purpose we collect it.
          Different laws may also require us to keep different data for different periods of time.

          The Conduct of Employment Agencies and Employment Businesses Regulations 2003, require us to keep work-seeker
          records for at least one year from (a) the date of their creation or (b) after the date on which we last
          provide you with work-finding services.
          <br><br>
          We must also keep your payment records for as long as is legally required by HMRC and associated national
          minimum wage, social security and tax legislation.
          Where the Company has obtained your consent to process your personal data, we will do so in line with our
          retention policy of two years from last contact. Upon expiry of that period the Company will seek further
          consent from you. Where consent is not granted the Company will cease to process your personal data and
          sensitive data.

        </ol>

            In the course of its legitimate activities, processing is carried out with appropriate safeguards by a

            trade
            union aim and on condition that the processing relates only to members or former members (or those who have
            regular contact with it in connection with those purposes) and provided there is no disclosure to a third
